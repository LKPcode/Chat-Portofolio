# DeLottery - A decentralized lottery Design and Implementation

This is a simple UI for a decentralized lottery. It is built using Vue3.js / Vite and TailwindCSS.

Just a quick 2-days project to familiarize myself with the Figma Design Platform and TailwindCSS.

No buisness logic is implemented, just the User Interface.

Based on my figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/TOtdehcgZYZWJW2zjZJBlU/Lottery?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

Deployed on Vercel [here](https://de-lottery-pi.vercel.app/)
