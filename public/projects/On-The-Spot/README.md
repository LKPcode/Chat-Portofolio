# On The Spot

On The Spot is a web application that makes spot trading on Binance easier. It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies in a more efficient way by providing a simple and intuitive interface. Reallocation of funds is made easy by just a few clicks. 

### How to use

1. Add your Binance API key and secret clicking on the Manage Keys button on the top right corner.
2. Select the Crypto Currencies you want to trade and the percentage of the total amount you want to reallocate.
3. Select the Crypto Currency you want to trade for and the percentage of the total amount you want to allocate to each one.
4. Click on the Trade button and confirm the trade. The application will automatically execute the trades on Binance while finding the cheapest (in trading fees) pair paths.
5. Done! Your funds have been reallocated.

### Use Case

* Imagine you have a portfolio of cryptocurrencies and you want to reallocate your funds. You have 10 different cryptocurrencies and you want to sell 5 of them to buy the other 5. You could do this manually on Binance, but it would take a lot of time and you would have to pay a lot of trading fees. With On The Spot, you can do this in just a few clicks and save time and trading fees.
* With On-The-Spot you can think in a percentage of your portfolio instead of the amount of each cryptocurrency you have. This way you can easily reallocate your funds without having to calculate the amount of each cryptocurrency.
* In just one click you are able to sell all your crypto for a stablecoin. No need to do it manually for each pair.
